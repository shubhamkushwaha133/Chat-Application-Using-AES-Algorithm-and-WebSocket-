The project proposes to design a web-based interface to communicate from one computer to
another using TCP client-server paradigm through browser. The communication will be
two-way communication which will be secured by any of the selected cryptographic
algorithms such as Affine, Hill, Playfair, ElGamal, AES, DES etc. by the users on both ends.
The sending and receiving of the encrypted text on the web will be developed using socket
programming based on TCP client server model and Web Sockets. The interface is designed
for multiple users i.e. any number of users can connect in a room and chat with each other. In
the interface the user will be asked for login username and password i.e. the information
submitted during signup on the web page. After successful login the user will be asked if
he/she wants to create a room or enter a room. After submitting the required inputs, the user
types the message after clicking on the send button the message is encrypted with an access
key of the room and the encrypted text will be sent to the intended computers where the other
users can decrypt the message using the correct access key of the room. In the same way the
other users can reply and both users can communicate with one another. The whole
communication is secured using the room access key which is used to encrypt and decrypt the
message.
